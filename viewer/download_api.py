"""Run one backend's weight download, and report honestly on how it is going.

`AGENTS.md` forbids fetching weights before the user has confirmed which pipeline and
which route. The Setup & Status page is where they confirm; this is what runs afterwards.

**Progress is measured, not parsed.** `huggingface_hub` draws tqdm bars with carriage
returns and ANSI escapes, which pipe into a browser as garbage, and each backend's
bootstrap prints something different anyway. Instead the target directory is polled and
compared against the size the catalogue already knows, which gives one progress mechanism
for all three backends, survives a resumed download, and does not care what the tool
prints. The log is kept alongside, stripped of escape codes, for diagnosis.

**Three signals, because one is not enough.** Directory growth says whether bytes are
arriving; the process exit code says whether it worked; the log tail says why it did not.
A download that has grown by nothing for `STALL_SECONDS` is reported as stalled rather
than left to look like slow progress, which is the failure people actually hit.
