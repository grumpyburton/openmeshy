"""What each backend needs on disk, so nothing is ever downloaded by surprise.

`AGENTS.md` makes this a rule: no script, bootstrap, viewer button or agent tool may fetch
weights until the user has confirmed which pipeline and which route. A rule needs numbers
to be honest about, and until now the viewer had none: `/api/backends` described stages
and settings but never said that picking TRELLIS.2 means ~16 GB from Hugging Face.

This module is that missing half. It is deliberately pure data plus pure functions over a
filesystem, with no imports from `generate_api`, so the onboarding screen, the CLI
bootstraps and the tests can all read the same catalogue without a circular import.

**Sizes are approximate and measured, not authoritative.** They come from a real install
on 2026-09-21 (`du -sh`) and exist to set expectations before a download, not to verify
one. Treat a mismatch as a stale constant, never as a failure.

**Licence text here is a pointer, not advice.** Each entry names the licence and links to
the original; reading it is the user's business. The one exception is a restriction with
real teeth, such as Hunyuan's territorial limits, which is surfaced as a caveat because
silently downloading those weights in a restricted region is a harm we would be causing.
