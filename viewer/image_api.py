"""Text to image, one step upstream of everything else in this repo.

Every other tool here starts from a picture. This one makes the picture, for people who
do not have one yet. It drives `stable-diffusion.cpp` (a prebuilt Metal binary in
`vendor/sdcpp/`) against Qwen-Image 2.1 in GGUF form.

Two things are deliberate:

**The defaults are the measured fast ones, not the upstream ones.** The model's own recipe
says `--cfg-scale 6.0`, which makes it do two passes per step for nothing, because
Qwen-Image 2.1 does not use guidance. Measured on one Mac on 2026-09-22: cfg 6.0 at 1024px
took 17 minutes, cfg 1.0 took 11, and 768px at 10 steps took 4m22s for the same picture.
So the defaults here are cfg 1.0, 10 steps, 768px. **Those timings are one machine.** A
faster chip does better and an NVIDIA card is in a different league; nothing here should
be read as "this is how long it takes".

**The licence travels with the image.** Running Qwen-Image is non-commercial; the pictures
it makes are yours, per Qwen's own statement. Every run writes a sidecar saying both, because
a PNG in a folder six months from now remembers nothing on its own.
