"""Install Pixal3D (raven38/pixal3d.cpp): a `trellis-cli` build plus its Q8_0 weights.

Two halves, the same way the viewer tracks every backend. The **build** depends on the
machine:

- **Apple Silicon:** cloned and compiled from source, because Metal kernels need the
  local Xcode toolchain. That needs full Xcode, not just the Command Line Tools.
- **Linux or Windows with an NVIDIA card:** upstream's prebuilt CUDA 12 build, runtime
  included, when the driver is new enough for it (575+, i.e. CUDA 12.9). About a minute,
  no compiler. It runs upstream's 12 steps (our 8-step patch needs a source build); on
  NVIDIA that costs seconds, while a compile costs 15 minutes on a fast pod and far more
  on an 8-CPU machine.
- **Linux, driver too old for the prebuilt, CUDA toolkit present:** compiled locally for
  this card instead. `--compile` asks for that even when the prebuilt would run. With
  neither, it says which driver to install and stops.
- **Linux with an AMD card:** upstream's prebuilt ROCm build (175 MB) when ROCm is
  installed, else the Vulkan build (26 MB). No compiler, no driver version to check.
  Vulkan would be the lighter choice, and upstream measured it faster on Strix Halo,
  but on a Radeon RX 9060 XT (RDNA4, Mesa 26.2 RADV, 2026-10-08) it produced zero
  voxels with cooperative matrices on and NaNs in the sparse-conv decoder with them
  off. The ROCm build made the same chest in 8.5 minutes with no NaNs anywhere.

The **weights** are the single-view Q8_0 set plus the BiRefNet matting model, 8.4 GB, and
BiRefNet-lite (224 MB), the background remover Pixal3D's cut-out uses. Without lite the
cut-out falls back to u2net, which ate a white robot's upper arms on a fresh install.

`AGENTS.md`: a download path must name the backend, name the route, state the size, and
require an affirmative answer. This prints all of that and stops, unless `--yes` is given
for non-interactive use. Defaulting to yes is not allowed, so it does not.

    python scripts/bootstrap_pixal3d.py            # says what it wants, then asks
    python scripts/bootstrap_pixal3d.py --yes      # for the viewer and for agents
    python scripts/bootstrap_pixal3d.py --build-only
    python scripts/bootstrap_pixal3d.py --weights-only
