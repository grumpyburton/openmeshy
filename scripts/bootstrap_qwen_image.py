"""Install the text-to-image route: a stable-diffusion.cpp binary and Qwen-Image weights.

Two halves, the same way the viewer tracks every other backend. The **build** is a
prebuilt `stable-diffusion.cpp` release binary. Nothing is compiled: upstream publishes a
Metal build for Apple Silicon, a CUDA build for Windows and a Vulkan build for Linux, which
runs on NVIDIA and AMD cards. The **weights** are three files totalling about 13.4 GB.

`AGENTS.md`: a download path must name the backend, name the route, state the size, and
require an affirmative answer. This prints all of that and stops, unless `--yes` is given
for non-interactive use. Defaulting to yes is not allowed, so it does not.

    python scripts/bootstrap_qwen_image.py            # says what it wants, then asks
    python scripts/bootstrap_qwen_image.py --yes      # for the viewer and for scripts
    python scripts/bootstrap_qwen_image.py --build-only
