# scripts/

Every command-line tool in the pipeline, grouped by what you are trying to do. One
script, one job: nothing here is imported by `image_to_3dlab/`, and anything worth
reusing was pulled out as a module-level function so it can be tested without Blender
or a GPU.

Each summary below is the script's own first line. `tests/test_scripts_registry.py`
fails if a script is missing from this file or if a summary has drifted from the
docstring, so a new script is not finished until it is listed here.

Most tools print their real documentation with `--help`; the docstring at the top of
each file explains *why* it exists, which is usually the part you need.

## Generate an asset

Run a backend end to end, or re-run part of one without paying for the whole thing again.

For the staged **fitted metarig → proxy weights → reference pose → tunable gait →
standing transition** workflow, start with [the quadruped pipeline guide](../docs/quadruped-pipeline.md).
It includes commands, parameter definitions, failure checks, and an LLM-assisted
tuning checklist. Manual fitting and visual weight/deformation review remain required.

For **prop sheets** (many props from one image in one run, then split and finished into
game-ready LODs), start with [the prop sheet guide](../docs/prop-sheets.md).

## Vendor patches

`vendor/` is git-ignored, so every fix to someone else's checkout lives here as a re-appliable patch script. Each one asserts its anchor and is idempotent; re-running after a bootstrap is the intended workflow.
